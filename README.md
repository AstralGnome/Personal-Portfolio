# Personal-Portfolio

##Description

I have developed a responsive personal portfolio page that uses links, images, and text to showcase my growing web development abilities.

##Usage

When you click on the links in the nav-bar they will anchor to their corresponding locations on the webpage. Also, when you decrease the size of the window all of the elements should be obvserved to respond dynamically and smoothly while maintaining a consistent aesthetic.
